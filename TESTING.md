    ![Timeout](documentation/testing/js/jstimeoutfunction.png)

  - JavaScript was used to initiate the TinyMCE editor. 
    - This was tested manually as well. The editor works on the local and deployed site.
    - The code template was found in the [Tiny Docs Quick Start](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/quick-start/)
